# Bog App Summary
  Overall, this assignment went really well.  I seemed to have the most trouble with the form_for helper and with refactoring the code; particularly refactoring the form_for helper after adding the create route.  I got stuck on that every single round after the first one.  Also, I had trouble with syntactical issues of knowing when to add a colon and where, or when you need two colons, like in the destroy method.  Colons tripped me up.  The other thing I had trouble with was knowing when it was new vs. create and same with delete vs. destroy.  I had some of those mixed up which tripped me up a few times as well.  It was really great practice to do this app over and over again.  It helped solidify the order to go in, to build the routes, then build the controllers, then build the views and see it all render on the screen as you work through CRUD.  

## Tips
  <ul>
    <li>Watch out for delete vs. destroy! And new vs. create!</li>
    <li>Pay attention to creature vs. creature(s) vs. @creature</li>
    <li>Check your routes to make sure you're using the verbs correctly - particularly with edit/update - You need a                 separate verb for edit (GET) and update (PUT/PATCH)</li>
  </ul>
